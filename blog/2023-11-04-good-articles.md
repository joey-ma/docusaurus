At work, a lot has happened, and I'd like to eventually (not today) reflect on my journey with my current firm. When I saw this [reaction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdCXUVhVSEE) by ThePrimeTime, I'm reminded of some good principals, and things I've read from good articles, and concepts discussed regarding how my team was going about with the development process, and I'm going to try to document them here *later*.

Here's [Kent C. Dodds](https://x.com/kentcdodds?s=20)'s [Why I Won't Use Next.js](https://www.epicweb.dev/why-i-wont-use-nextjs).

Here's [Lee Robinson](https://twitter.com/leeerob)'s [Why I'm Using Next.js](https://leerob.io/blog/using-nextjs)

Some interesting points:
1. Whatever you use is probably fine. 
1. Your tool choice matters much less than your skill at using the tool to accomplish your desired outcome (a great user experience).
1. I want to point out that features matter less than capabilities.
1. Because at the end of the day, I just want to make the world a better place by teaching you how to build quality software.
